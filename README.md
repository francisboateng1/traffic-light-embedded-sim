# Smart Traffic Light Controller
(Simulation)

## Description 
This project simulates a traffic light system using c++
It cycles through RED, GREEN, and YELLOW states with fixed timing delays,
mimicking the behavior of an embedded system.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- MinGW-W64 (GCC)
- VS Code
- Windows

## How It Works
- RED light stays on for 5 seconds
- GREEN LIght stays on for 5 seconds
- YELLOW Light stays on for 2 seconds
- The system runs continuously using an infinite loop

## What I Learned
- Embedded system state logic
- Timing control using delays
- structuring code with functions
- compiling and running C++ programs using terminal.
